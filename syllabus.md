## Course Description

We live in a world where we have more data, computational power, and access to digital connectivity than ever before. But how do we make sense of the promise inherent in this reality while also coming to terms with the challenges that it presents? How do we situate the technologies that we have come to take for granted? And more importantly, how do we create active and creative responses that interrogate and hint at the potential for different futures?  

This course examines emergent technological fields, spanning topics like data collection/representation, artificial intelligence, social algorithms, surveillance, and digital mapping and asks how the technologies inherent to each can be leveraged for response, creation, and critique. Students will be asked to switch between historically considering the current technological moment and analyzing previous ones.

While this course is primarily conceptual and theory-based, the content covered will be technical in nature and students will be tasked with making three creative responses to the content in the tradition of the new media/digital art and design worlds. 

## Course Objectives 

In this class, students will:

- Consider technology from a sociotechnical and political gaze. This entails understanding what technology offers, does, and situating it within its context, history, and variable perspectives
- Understand the various contours of the field of new media art 
- Investigate different types of and fields for creative response, creation, and exploration, situated within but not limited to, the arts. 
- Create works of art that engage with and further conversation about emerging technology


## Format

The first third  of the class are an introduction to thinking about and diving into making art and doing creative work. This section is intended to provide students with The last two thirds take this model, but then adapt it for considering and responding to emerging technology.  Students will work individually, in pairs, and in groups over the course of the semester. 

The workload for this class is not necessarily consistent, and there are different types of work that students will be asked to do. There are some weeks in which you'll be taking in and making sense of lots of material. In these weeks, you'll have lots of reading and writing assignments. In other weeks, you'll be pushed to prototype and produce substantive projects. In those times you'll be doubling down on a particular project. Some weeks you'll be putting in lots of extra hours, and in other weeks you won't have as much to deliver on. In the course, we jump between making and thinking, and spend a great deal of time doing research and critique, the two actions that support making and thinking. 

This is not a technical class. With the exception of a couple of lessons, we will rarely be teaching a clear library, tool, or sensor. In this class, I am more interested in what you *choose* to make then what you are *able* to make. That said,  we operate with the assumption that all students have the background of Creative Computing and HyperCinema, and therefore that all students are equipped to use electronics, physical computing, programming, animation, film, and more to create work. In addition, we make sure that all students have plenty of support to create the types of projects that they envision. 

## Expectations and Requirements

- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments 
- Three section projects + accompanying documentation posts 

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All homework should be completed and submitted using the homework form the night before the day that it is due. 

In accordance with NYU policy, students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible.

## Syllabus
### Week 1

####Jan 28:  **Introductions, part 1**   
*This class will introduce us to one another and set up the topics of the semester, conveying why we should even use art/creative mediums as a way to think through emerging technology, and why we should use emerging technology to make art.*

**Assignment:** 

- Read:
  - " [Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/)", Michael Mohammed Ahmad. Sydney Review of Books, 2016. 

- Do:
  - Set up a blog or website for this class. For more control under the hood, I recommend creating a site using [Github Pages](https://medium.com/spemer/free-github-blog-and-hosting-with-jekyll-c24c408d158f) (for example, [this one](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) is very straightforward). But you can also use Are.na, Tumblr, Canvas, Wordpress, or any other platform. You just need a place where all of your homework goes! 
  - After you've finished the reading and made your website, post a 250-300 word response on your thoughts about *Bad Writer* on your blog. Why do you think I've asked you to read this piece? What connection does it have to our class? Submit the link to this response using the homework form.  


####Jan 30: Introductions, part 2   
*Discussion: what does it mean to evaluate art? Introduce a shared vocabulary.*

**Assignment:** 

- Read: 
  - "[A Lexicon of the Indigenous Body: Images of Autonomy and Desire]( https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-lexicon-of-the-indigenous-body-images-of-autonomy-and-desire)", Natalie Diaz 
  - *[Beyond New Media Art](http://www.linkartcenter.eu/public/editions/Domenico_Quaranta_Beyond_New_Media_Art_Link_Editions_ebook_2013.pdf)*, Domenica Quaranta (read pages 20 -41 in the book) 
  - [optional] Kahlil Gibran https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58706/the-pomegranate
- Do: 
  - After you've done the readings, write 400-500 words on your relationship to art, and specifically what forms of creative content inspire you. Some starting place questions: What are the types of things you think about when you imagine the work you'd like to create? This can be books, movies, anime, graphic novels, poetry, installations, or any form of creative content. What is it that inspires you about it specifically? Is it the tone, the way it makes you feel, the design work, the twists in the story, etc?   You're here in a program about making art (or at the very least in a class about it), how do you see your relationship to creative content? 
    - Diaz talks about what it means for indigenous people to create art that is necessarily outside of the mainstream. Is there anything about this that resonates with you? Have you thought about what position the art or creative content that you enjoy holds, and what it means for you to like and know about it? 


### Week 2

####Feb 4: New Media Art  
  *What is new media art? An introduction via an array of examples*

  **Assignment:** 

- Do:

  - If you didn't make it through the list of examples from class, make sure that you look at all of them before class on Thursday! The link to the list of projects you saw is [here]() (link forthcoming). You can also find a copy in the week2 folder. 

  

#### Feb 6: Evaluating New Media Art 

  *We continue our discussion of the examples from class on Tuesday. What stood out to you? What did you notice?* 

 **Assignment:** 

 - Do: 
   -  Last week you read "[Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/)", by Michael Mohammad Ahmad. In the text, Ahmad talks about the need for those making creative works to have communities who can engage critically with their work.  **Choose the work that most stood out to you and evaluate and respond to it by writing a 400-500 word review/critique of it.**  What is the piece trying to do or say? What about the piece appeals to you? What works about it? What doesn't work? What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact? Consider aspects like content, form, style, context, etc. Be thorough and thoughtful. Post the response on your blog or website and submit it using the homework form. 
     -  NOTE: When I say "critique", I don't mean that you should be mean or aggressive. What I mean is that you should deeply engage with the piece, whether it appealed to you or not. It is totally fine to take the position that the work you are reviewing is a masterpiece, but you do need to explain to us why you think this. 
     -  The link to the list of projects you saw is [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/CAET2018). You can also find a copy in the week2 folder. 

- Read:

  - Olia Lialina, "Not Art&Tech". http://contemporary-home-computing.org/art-and-tech/not

    

### Week 3

#### Feb 11: Introduction to Project 1   

  *Summarize what we've covered in the first two weeks and discuss the first project. Provide a sample of working through a project in class as a group exercise (going from nothing to something)*

  **Assignment:** 

- Do:
  - Go to an exhibition, gallery, screening, lecture, or event. It must be something that you can't experience just by sitting at your computer, something that you have to physically attend.  Bonus points if it involves digital, new media, technology-focused, or contemporary art. We're missing an essential element of art by not being able to experience the works that we've been talking about, and it will be helpful to you to see a work in its natural habitat. 
    - Document your experience and write about the exhibition, show, or work that you visited for your homework. Questions to use as starting places: Are you looking at the piece differently now than you would have before you entered the class? How did the context of the work—including but not limited to staging and curation—affect your understanding?  When did you look at the wall text or ask anyone for context on the work? How was the visit overall? Elaborate in your post. 
  - Begin brainstorming your project idea.
- Read:
  - The guidelines for the first project so that you're prepared (find in project1 folder)

#### Feb 13: Work on Project 1 

  *Time in class to work on and discuss the project. Arnab and I will meet with each of the students and check in with them on different aspects.*

 **Assignment:** 

- Do:
  - Work on your project! 
- Read:
  - Jentery Sayer's [Before You Make A Thing](https://jentery.github.io/ts200v2/notes.html)  
  - *Just Art Stuff* (readings folder)

### Week 4

#### Feb 18: Art as Argument, Technology as Material 

  *Discussion of the readings, and of what it means to see art as an argument. This is useful while they're working on their projects.*

 **Assignment:** 

 - Do:

   	- Work on your project! 

 - Read:  

   - [optional] Zadie Smith, "[Dance Lessons for Writers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/zadie-smith-what-beyonce-taught-me)" 

   - [optional] James Baldwin, "[On the Creative Process](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/20/james-baldwin-the-creative-process/)"

     

#### Feb 20: On presenting work 

  *A quick discussion about presenting work and documenting work. Maybe we can bring Rob in to do a quick demo on staging things, using equipment from the ER, etc? Or a resident can come in and talk about this.  Then the rest of the class is time to work.* 

 **Assignment:** 

- Work on your project! 


### Week 5

#### Feb 25: Present Project 1 

  *First half of class presents projects .*

**Assignment:**

- Make sure that you have created a documentation post for your project and submitted it using the homework link.

- Do:
  - After you've done the readings, post a 300-500 word response about the history of the Internet. Was it a surprise to you? Do you consider this *your* history? Barlow's declaration, in particular, is a famous document in Internet history because it captures the promise and orientation of many early hackers to the Internet when it was first being shaped. Do you agree with his claims, and do you think they still exist today? 

### Week 6 

#### March 3: The Internet: an historical overview

  *We spent the first six weeks walking through the process of what it means to do creative work, everything from evaluation, to what the work does, to how we present and show it. But that was all priming us to be able to do this is in a grander way, where we're responding to actual emerging technology. For the rest of the semester, we'll be focusing on two large topics: the internet and data + automation. You'll learn how to think about these from different perspectives and points of view, and then you'll be tasked with creating a piece that responds to it.*

  - Once you've finished all of the readings and other assignments, write a 200-300 word response on one or both of the readings. What stood out to you? What is compelling, what are you still thinking about? What are you considering about the internet that you didn't know before? What do you want to know more about? 

#### March 5: The Internet: an infrastructural overview 

*How does the internet actually work? How does it show up in our everyday lives? What kind of internet infrastructure can you identify in the city and the building?*

 **Assignment:** 

- Do:
  - In the vein of the Field Guide to New York and the exercise we did in class today, go around your dorm, apartment, or neighborhood and try and notice how much internet infrastructure you see. Take pictures and document the experience on your blog. What are you seeing that you didn't notice before? Is this experience changing your idea of what it means to be "online"?
