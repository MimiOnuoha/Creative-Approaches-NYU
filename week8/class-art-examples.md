## Class Art Examples

- [Image Objects](https://anthology.rhizome.org/image-objects), Artie Vierkrant: 2011

  - The idea that art is being experienced more through photographs. Each image originates as a digital file, then it's printed on aluminum composite panels so they seem three dimensional. When they're photographed, Vierkant moves them in order to create a new variation which differs noticeably from the object. Hence, image objects.
