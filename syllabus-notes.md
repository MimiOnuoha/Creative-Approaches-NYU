## Week 2 Artist list 

Include Nam June Paik in the list of artists

also include someone who the students in Creative Computing mentioned, or some more collective operating in Hong Kong, China. I think it's important for us to be able 







- for early weeks, make a list of all the different types of art. socially engaged, conceptual, video, digital, internet, sculpture, modernist, abstract, 
- 
- 
- So we start doing this without even introducing the technology. We start by just thinking and talking about what it means to be making different types of art. 
- this is not a technical class. I'm not going to teach you how to make something technical. I'm going to assume that you already know. You've taken creative computing, you've taken hypercinema, and if you haven't taken those classes, then you've taken. Towards the end of the class, for the last section, the exercises we do will be more technical, but even then its using technology as research. 
- how do you balance theory and practice? 
- however, we will provide support to you for this class! 
- the first project is really deigned to help get you working through creating creative and artistic projects. 
- This class will teach you:
  - why we make art
  - how to make it well (project development)
  - how to speak about your art and the work that you see in the world, the things around you
  - how to make sense of a technological concept and examine it in different ways
  - how to respond to a technological concept
  - I want you to emerge with work that you are proud of. 
- it's a class where you get scaffolding. the work is variable, some weeks you will work a lot. other weeks you won't work that much because your work will be to think over and understand issues. You'll jump between making and thinking about making. 
- What makes something a new media piece? (make sure that they know this is a changing field, and we're defining it even as we are in it.)
  - it's using technology  (typically interactive, but what does it mean for something to be interactive?)
  - it's responding TO technology
  - it considers tech as its material 
  - it's talking about technology 
- what are the hard weeks? 
  - weeks 1 -2 are about taking in information 
  - weeks 3 and 4 are intense production weeks (you'll be putting in extra hours)
    - how many hours? enough so that you're proud of what you make. 
  - weeks  6 and 7 are big research weeks with lots of reading and writing for you to do
  - week 8 is a big production week. 
  - 
  - weeks 
- Life as a creative person is not always structured It's not that every week you have the same amount of work, and that it's the same. The excitement is in how it changes. So it's not the same every week, but I want to make sure that y'all are prepared, so I have all of your homework assignments written out ahead of time so that you're not surprised (and so that if you really want, you can do stuff early)

we try to go slightly off the typical schedule so you're not fitting this in around other classes (at )

To talk about a a subject you have to understand at least a bit of how it works, you have to situate it in a context



note the specificities of the projects 

Ask Arnab if he wants to lead a class one of these days. 

sometimes art is about giving you different ways to imagine the world. what if it were different. 

You can be trained in STS 

What if we only had rights in groups? 

Media Art also allows us to take from different fields:

	- You can think about feminism by thinking about LAUREN or by reading Haraway or by reading Braiding Sweetgrass or by participating in this economy and practice
	- Media art is also about being the ones doing the work and speaking about the work that's done. Understanding the technology helps to understand the analysis. There's this issue of people coming in and speaking about it, this question of distance of being a stranger but in this space, in this field, you are not a stranger. You are not a stranger to it. 
	- You can be trained in 



Week 3:

- [note to self: write up the guide for project one! The medium for the piece should be tied to whatever they know. ]
- [note to self two: the idea generation is the moment of possibility. this is what we're interested in at first. Wonderful!]
- 

ME:



The true issue with Western science is the assumption that in the artifact we can find everything we need. We can find the answers, it is enough. 

Coming from an Igbo understanding, the object is never enough. The object never could be.
