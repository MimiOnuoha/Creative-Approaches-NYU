## Internet Timeline



**1858** - First transatlantic telegraph cable becomes operational

**1947** - The transistor is developed. Transistors work as  amplifiers or switches. They can each one can be switched on or off. Therefore each transistor can be in two distinct states, or store two numbers: 0 and 1. 

**1954** - Time-sharing is first described by John Backus. Early computers at this time are extremely expensive devices, and programs might take hours to run. Batch processing techniques are invented to decrease dead periods since computers were so slow and expensive; th idea is that programs could be queued up so as soon as one is completed the next started. Time-sharing develops to allow multiple users to share a computing resource without owning one. (note: advent of the personal computer spells the decline of time-sharing)

**1957** - Soviet Union launches Sputnik I, the first successful artificial satellite, into space. Start of the Space Race 

**1958** - ARPA,  Advanced Research Projects Agency  (originally ARPA)is created. It is responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military. Created under president Eisenhower. 

**1958** - National Defense Education Act is passed, which allows for million in public funds devoted to boosting the USA's science and mathematics fields. 

- NASA is also created around this time! 

**1959** - Integrated circuit is created. It allows multiple transistors to be placed on single silicon wafer. This allowed for more powerful circuits.   few transistor switches together can create logic gates: they compare several input currents and give different outputs as a result. Just like if/and statements. 

**1960** - Paul Baran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran) publishes his first proposal for a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s. Packet switching: a networking design that divides messages up into arbitrary packets, with routing decisions made per-packet. 

**1960** - Computers using Integrated Circuits begins to appear. These computers did stuff like flight control, desk calculations. They were expensive and slow,  often used in places like universities. (include picture)

 - Independently, [Donald Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies) ([National Physical Laboratory, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK)), proposed and was the first to put into practice a local area network based on what he called [packet switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching), the term that would ultimately be adopted.

   

**1962** -  Cuban Missile Crisis occurs. (Confrontation between the US and Soviet Union initiated by the American discovery of Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba. The  confrontation is often considered [the closest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls) the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) came to escalating into a full-scale [nuclear war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare))

**1962** -  J.C.R. Licklider (then in charge writes about his "Intergalactic Computer Network" concept. This would "interconnect time-shared computers to create a powerful national web of interactive supercomputing."

- The existing national defense network](http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-internet) relied on telephone lines and wires that were susceptible to damage

**1965** - The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 is passed. It abolishes the earlier quota system based on national origin and establishes new immigration policy that attracts skilled labor to the US. It also greatly changes the demographic make-up of the U.S. and ushers in a wave of immigration from countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America

- This is responsible for immigrants from Taiwan a,d Hong Kong, then China, and India and the former Soviet Union become the engineering backbone of hundreds of start-ups and large tech companies. 
- also responsible for the assembly-line workers from Mexico and Southeast Asia who soldered the semiconductors, built the desktops, fabricated the routes. 

**1967** -  Under Bob Taylor's lead at ARPA, ARPANET is created. The network is "made by and for academics, and it reflects their priorities: ease of communication, nonhierarchical collaboration, with no particular hardware or software platform favored over another"

**1968** -  Tommy smith and John Carlos raise their fists in the Black Power salute at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City 

**1968** -  2001: A Space Odyssey comes out and features a story of a supercomputer that seizes control of a deep-space mission from its human astronauts. 

**1969** -  ARPANET goes live. BBN installs the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer is connected to the network. SRI (Stanford Research Institute) becomes the second node on the network. The next two nodes added are at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. 

**1969**- Several hundred students occupy the Stanford Applied Electronics Lab, demanding that the university shut down SRI and the classified projects that it is carrying out with military money. 

**1970** - ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, or Network Control Protocol is introduced. This meant that network users could begin to develop applications. 

**1971** - The microprocessor makes its public debut thanks to Intel. Microprocessors were a step beyond Integrated circuits in that they were programmable. They could turn any sort of appliance or device into a computer. 

- By computer, we mean that it accepts binary data, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. 

**1972** - email is introduced to be an easy coordination mechanism for ARPANET developers. 

**1973-75** -The US, along with much of the Western world, goes through a period of economic recession that results in rising inflation and puts many industries out of business. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley did not suffer any such recession on account of the strength of its products.  

**1974** - The specification of the resulting protocol, the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP), was published as [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) [675](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675) by the Network Working Group in December 1974.[[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet#cite_note-82) It contains the first attested use of the term *internet*, as a shorthand for *internetworking*.

**1975** - First introduction of Internet Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol to ARPANET. TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the network. TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination

**1975** - Bill Gates and Paul Allen found Microsoft.

**1977** - The first successfully mass marketed personal computer to be announced was the [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET) .  Three months later, the Apple II is released, along with the TRS-80. Mass-mark personal computers had arrived! 

**1980's** - Immigrants from India and China are at the helm of nearly 1/4 of Silicon Valley companies 

**1980** - Apple runs its legendary advertisement for its personal computer. The ad copy says: "Think of the large computers (the mainframes and the minis) as the passenger trains and the Apple personal computer as a Volkswagen." Begins to usher in the decade of the personal computer.

**1980** - Usenet is created. It's dubbed "poor man's ARPANET", and it allows users to transfer files and exchange email. To enter Usenet, users tap into a newsgroup where content is created by participants on discussion boards. Usenet is one of many bulletin board services. By 1995, more than 70,000 BBSs exist and are used by all sorts

**1981** -There are 213 hosts on the ARPANET network. 

**1983** - "In 1983, the [U.S. military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military) portion of the ARPANET was broken off as a separate network, the [MILNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILNET). MILNET subsequently became the unclassified but military-only [NIPRNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIPRNET), in parallel with the SECRET-level [SIPRNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNET) and [JWICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWICS) for TOP SECRET and above. NIPRNET does have controlled security gateways to the public Internet."

**1981**- The NSF (National Science Foundation ) funds the creation of CSNET, a computer network for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET. 

**1983**- Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility group is formed, intended to object agains the use of computers in warfare. 

**1985** - The NSF funds NSFNET. Originally NSFNET was created to facilitate an academic research network. Researchers would be allowed to gain access to the supercomputing centers funded by NSF in the United States. The network flourished, even as it was mostly used by academics and researchers. But it also allowed college students to have internet access in their dorm rooms since its in universities and allowed private-sector companies to connect to NSFNET.

**1988** - First international connection to NSFNET happens (to CWI in the Netherlands) 

**1989** - Japan connects to NSFNET (first connection to Asia)

**1989** - Tim Berners-Lee proposes the idea of hypertext, text that has links to other text that readers can immediately access. It allows for the cross-referencing of information. He also creates the World wide Web, an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by URLS (Uniform Resource Locators), which hare interlinked by hypertext and accessible over the internet. 

**1989** - In 1989, the first Internet service providers, companies offering the public direct access to the Internet for a monthly fee, were established in the US and Australia. 

**1990** - H-1B visa program is created, which allows technical workers a path to permanent residency in the US.

**1990** - Electronic Frontier Foundation is created to protect digital rights. 

​		- In April 1990, Barlow was visited by an FBI agent concerning theft and distribution of source code for Macintosh ROMs.  Barlow described the visit as "complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be." This experience led to the formation of the EFF. 

**1990** - Tim Berners Lee creates the first web browser (WorldWideWeb),  or software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. He also creates HTML, which provides a common tongue for all the information the internet.  (so when a user requests a website, the web browser can retrieve content from the web server and then display the resulting web page on the user's device. [The web is not the internet! The web is one means of accessing data online in the form of website and hyperlinks. Email is a different one!)]



**1992** - Congress passes the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act, which allowed NSF to support access by the research and education communities to computer networks which were not used exclusively for research and education purposes, thus permitting NSFNET to interconnect with commercial networks 

**1993** -The Clinton Administration puts $17 billion of investment in new technological research, fiber-optic infrastructure, and more. 

**1993** - Mosaic is released and becomes the world's first popular browser. Finally, people are able to access the web more easily. 

**1994** - Clinton Administration creates the Digital Libraries Project, which falls under DARPA, NSF, and NASA and puts $24 million to six academic computer science departments, including Stanford. Its goal is to help index and organize the Internet through building search technologies. 

**1998** - Google is launched by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, two graduate students at Stanford. The company is based off of algorithms that Page conceived under the Digital Libraries Project. 

**1995** -"" On October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution defining the term Internet. This definition was developed in consultation with members of the internet and intellectual property rights communities. RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language reflects our definition of the term “Internet”. “Internet” refers to the global information system that — (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein."

**1995-**  Microsoft debuts Internet Explorer! This cues a browser war with Netscape that Microsoft eventually wins (they get market share at over 95% by 2002).

**1995-** Programming language Java is introduced 

**1995-**eBay is launched from the bedroom of Pierre Omidyar

**1995** - Amazon.com is launched by Jeff Bezos. 

**1996** -The Communications Decency Act is published. It's the first notable attempt by Congress to regulate porn on the Internet. Free speech advocates fight to overturn the portion relating to indent speech, arguing that it should be protected under the First Amendment. The CDA frees We b platforms from liability for content on their sites uploaded by third parties—this is super relevant to platforms today.  

**1990s - early 2000s** - Web 1.0

**2000-2002** - DotCom crash 

**2004** - Mark Zuckerberg launches Facebook, one of the social networking sites that characterizes Web 2.0

**2006** - Twitter is founded 

**2007** -Apple iPhone is released

**2011** - Twitter is used as a tool for political organizing and communication during Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street
