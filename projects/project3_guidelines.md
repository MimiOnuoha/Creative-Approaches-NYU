# Project 3

## Debate Overview



The debates will take place on **May 7.** Each debate will be between two people, and will have two rounds. In your first round each participant will make an opening statement that lays out the major points of your argument. This should last for about **5 minutes**, and you can use slideshows, images, or any other creative format for making your point. In  your second round, you will have an opportunity to respond to the other person's opening statement.  In this round, you will each only have up to **3 minutes**

You can sign up for a debate topic here: https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Creative-Approaches-NYU/wiki/Debate-Sign-up. There are more topics than people, so if you don't sign up for the same issues I may have to reach out to adjust people's chosen topics. 



## Project Overview 

**Topic**: Data, Automation, AI, Algorithms 

Project Presentations will happen on **May 5**. 

Think about the conversations we have had about data collection, the internet, automation, and social algorithms. What do you think about all of this? What strikes you as good, or unfair, or unacknowledged, or worth diving into? What questions have you seen, and what answers (or explorations) do you have? Create a project that elucidates some aspect of your point of view. Make an argument, establish a position, decide what your opinion is, and communicate something to us. 

Since we are all remote and now everyone has access to the same equipment, you should plan for your project to be a prototype. It may be helpful for you to think of it as either:

- Something that looks the way you want it to, but doesn't work exactly as it's intended. For instance, this is like when instead of creating a website, you use a design tool to create a mockup of what that website would be like. 

  - The other version is when you have a project that works as you like, but doesn't look the way the final version should. In general, this is better to choose if the functionality of your project gets across its concept better than the design would. 

Whatever you choose, make  sure that you have a clear concept and your project demonstrates that concept in an interesting manner that is intelligible and interesting.  Be ambitious, be thoughtful, be thorough. 

### Presentations

Your presentations should be about 10 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is due the same week as your project.
