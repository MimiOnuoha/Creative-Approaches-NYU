# Project 2 

## Overview

**Topic**: The Internet

The internet has become an inherently interactive network that is crucial to how many of us conduct our lives today. For your second project, you need to work in teams to create an artwork or creative project about the internet. Think about all of the topics that we have covered— historical, infrastructural, experiential, and business model—about the internet. What stands out to you the most?  You could choose to focus on something that highlights a specific aspect of the internet (such as early 2000's blogging culture, [hypertext and nonlinearity online](https://twinery.org/), or the [different web experiences](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/) of people in different countries) or you can create a speculative project about the future or past of the internet. Maybe given the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, you just want to create some kind of content that is joyful and that can only be shared using the internet. Do whatever you want, but remember that what you are making should be a project. It must also be digital, or at least something that you and your group can work on remotely. You may want to consider Rhizome's [Net Art](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) Anthology for inspiration. 

If you are struggling, it may  help you to come up with a piece that answers a question. Starting from a question can help you identify the things that you find interesting to explore, or give you a direction for consideration. 

## Presentations

You have 17 minutes to use for your presentation. Keep in mind that this includes time for questions. You should shoot for a presentation that's 5-10 minutes. For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

**Your presentations will take place on April 9.** See below for information about order and structure. 

- For each group that presents, there will be one group providing written feedback and another group that is providing verbal feedback. 
- If you're providing written feedback, you'll just use this very simple form which has four questions. https://forms.gle/noArLub33oUMXouk8 
- If you're providing verbal feedback, then you have to respond with something: a comment, question, suggestion. That way we can have a conversation.
