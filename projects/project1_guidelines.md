# Project 1 

## Overview

**Topic: Response to existing artwork**
**Due date: February 25**

We've spent the last couple of weeks thinking deeply what it means to make artworks and creative interventions. For your first project assignment, you are tasked with creating a project that engages with both of these. 

For your week 2 homework assignment, you wrote a review of a new media art piece. For this assignment, you will work alone to create your own piece that emulates the style or subject of whatever project or piece you wrote about. 

For instance: if you chose to write about [*Prison Map*,](http://prisonmap.com/) then you could create your own website that holds a grid of all the satellite images of schools in Massachusetts, or you could create an in-person experience that is based off of the web one, etc. Your work should be in conversation with the original piece, so that we can see the connection between the two, but it should also address the points that you brought up about the work. 



## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was the project that you were responding to, and how did you think about how to approach doing this?  What did you end up with as a final piece? In which ways is your piece different from the original, and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating? You should use slides to present your work. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) on your blog that accompanies the project. Upload it using the homework link.
