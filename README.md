## Course Description

We live in a world where we have more data, computational power, and access to digital connectivity than ever before. But how do we make sense of the promise inherent in this reality while also coming to terms with the challenges that it presents? How do we situate the technologies that we have come to take for granted? And more importantly, how do we create active and creative responses that interrogate and hint at the potential for different futures?  

This course examines emergent technological fields, spanning topics like data collection/representation, artificial intelligence, social algorithms, surveillance, and digital mapping and asks how the technologies inherent to each can be leveraged for response, creation, and critique. Students will be asked to switch between historically considering the current technological moment and analyzing previous ones.

While this course is primarily conceptual and theory-based, the content covered will be technical in nature and students will be tasked with making three creative responses to the content in the tradition of the new media/digital art and design worlds. 

## Course Objectives 

In this class, students will:

- Consider technology from a sociotechnical and political gaze. This entails understanding what technology offers, does, and situating it within its context, history, and variable perspectives
- Understand the various contours of the field of new media art 
- Investigate different types of and fields for creative response, creation, and exploration, situated within but not limited to, the arts. 
- Create works of art that engage with and further conversation about emerging technology

## Format

The first third  of the class are an introduction to thinking about and diving into making art and doing creative work.  The last two thirds take this model, but then adapt it for considering and responding to emerging technology.  Students will work individually, in pairs, and in groups over the course of the semester. 

The workload for this class is not consistent, and there are different types of work that students will be asked to do. There are some weeks in which you'll be taking in and making sense of lots of material. In these weeks, you'll have many reading and writing assignments. In other weeks, you'll be pushed to prototype and create substantive work. Some weeks will require many hours of work, while in others you'll be asked to provide less. In the course, we jump between making and thinking, and spend a great deal of time doing research and critique, the two actions that support making and thinking. 

This is not strictly a technical class. With the exception of a couple of lessons, we will rarely be teaching a distinct library, tool, or sensor.  I am more interested in what you *choose* to make then what you are *able* to make. That said, we operate with the assumption that all students have the background of Creative Computing and HyperCinema, and therefore that all students are equipped to use electronics, physical computing, programming, animation, film, and more to create work. In addition, we ensure that all students have plenty of support to create the types of projects that they envision. 

## Expectations and Requirements

- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments 
- Three section projects + accompanying documentation posts 

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All homework should be completed and submitted using the homework form the night before the day that it is due. No late work is accepted! 

In accordance with NYU policy, students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 

## Evaluation

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

*25%* Homework and Class Participation   
*10%* Classmate Project Evaluations  
*20%* Project 1  
*20%* Project 2  
*25%* Project 3    

## Communication 

Arnab and I are both  available for office hours. 

For other inquiries, I can be reached via email at all times. During the week I respond to all student emails within 24 hours, during the weekend within 48 hours unless stated otherwise. 


## Social Codes 

Here are the social codes we agreed on together on the first day:
- No isms! And especially no subtle isms 

- No feigned surprise

- A protocol for if we break the social rules:
  - Ouch (point it out)
  - Oops (acknowledge that you did something, apologize, etc) 
  - Move on

- Explanation: if an ouch + oops occurs, check in with Mimi or Arnab (or expect one of us so one of us can see if it makes sense to facilitate a discussion on it.

  - Work on your project! Make some substantial progress. Bring in a prototype of something for class on Tuesday. It can be a sketch, a paper prototype, the beginnings of a website, code for a game, etc. Just something that shows you've made progress since our last meeting. 
  - Go to an exhibition if you haven't done it yet, and post your response under assignment 3.1. 

- Read:

  - skim through Jentery Sayer's [Before You Make A Thing](https://jentery.github.io/ts200v2/notes.html). This is composed of tips, questions, and prototyping techniques that may be useful for you going forward. 

    

### Week 2

#### Feb 4: New Media Art  

  *What is new media art? An introduction via an array of examples*

  **Assignment:** 

- Do:

  - Look at the rest of the examples of work! The link to the list of projects you saw is [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/CAEM-NYU). You can also find a copy in the week2 folder. 

  

#### Feb 6: Evaluating New Media Art 

  *We continue our discussion of the examples from class on Tuesday. What stood out to you? What did you notice?* 

 **Assignment:** 

- Do: 

  - Last week you read "[Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/)", by Michael Mohammad Ahmad. In the text, Ahmad talks about the need for those making creative works to have communities who can engage critically with their work.  **Choose the work that most stood out to you and evaluate and respond to it by writing a 400-500 word review/critique of it.**  What is the piece trying to do or say? What about the piece appeals to you? What works about it? What doesn't work? What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact? Consider aspects like content, form, style, context, etc. Be thorough and thoughtful. Post the response on your blog or website and submit it using the homework form under the category Assignment 2.2.
    - NOTE: When I say "critique", I don't mean that you should be mean or aggressive. What I mean is that you should deeply engage with the piece, whether it appealed to you or not. It is totally fine to take the position that the work you are reviewing is a masterpiece, but you do need to explain to us why you think this. 
    - The link to the list of projects you saw is [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/CAET2018). You can also find a copy in the week2 folder. 

- Read:

  - Olia Lialina, "Not Art&Tech". http://contemporary-home-computing.org/art-and-tech/not

    

### Week 1

#### Jan 28:  **Introductions, part 1**   

*This class will introduce us to one another and set up the topics of the semester, conveying why we should even use art/creative mediums as a way to think through emerging technology, and why we should use emerging technology to make art.*

**Assignment:** 

- Read:
  - " [Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/)", Michael Mohammed Ahmad. Sydney Review of Books, 2016. 
- Do:
  - Set up a blog or website for this class. For more control under the hood, I recommend creating a site using [Github Pages](https://medium.com/spemer/free-github-blog-and-hosting-with-jekyll-c24c408d158f) (for example, [this one](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) is very straightforward). But you can also use Are.na, Tumblr, Canvas, Wordpress, or any other platform. You just need a place where all of your homework goes! 
  - After you've finished the reading and made your website, post a 250-300 word response on your thoughts about *Bad Writer* on your blog. Why do you think I've asked you to read this piece? What connection does it have to our class? Submit the link to this response using the homework form.  

#### Jan 30: Introductions, part 2   

*Discussion: what does it mean to evaluate art? Introduce a shared vocabulary.*

**Assignment:** 

- Read: 
  - "[A Lexicon of the Indigenous Body: Images of Autonomy and Desire]( https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-lexicon-of-the-indigenous-body-images-of-autonomy-and-desire)", Natalie Diaz 
  - *[Beyond New Media Art](http://www.linkartcenter.eu/public/editions/Domenico_Quaranta_Beyond_New_Media_Art_Link_Editions_ebook_2013.pdf)*, Domenica Quaranta (read pages 20 -41 in the book) 
  - [optional] Kahlil Gibran https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58706/the-pomegranate
- Do: 
  - Fill out this survey on skills: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.gle/cGp4KpWC8rHzuxHq7&source=gmail&ust=1580484464910000&usg=AFQjCNFDkuyD_Yvog7gCpZsar4ZJIOTyiw
  - Fill out the office hours Doodle: https://doodle.com/poll/b954zydr7a5cw3vs
  - After you've done the readings, write 400-500 words on your relationship to art, and specifically what forms of creative content inspire you. What types of things do you think about when you imagine the work you'd like to create? You can talk about books, movies, anime, plays, musicals, graphic novels, poetry, installations, fanfiction/fanart, or any form of creative content. What is it that inspires you about it specifically? Is it the tone, the way it makes you feel, the design work, the twists in the story, etc?   You're here in a program about making art (or at the very least in a class about it), how do you see your relationship to creative content? 
    - Diaz talks about what it means for indigenous people to create art that is necessarily outside of the mainstream. Is there anything about this that resonates with you? Have you thought about what position the art or creative content that you enjoy holds, and what it means for you to like and know about it?
